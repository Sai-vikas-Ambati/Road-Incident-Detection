# Road Incident Detection

The **Road Incident Detection** project is a computer vision + data analysis tool to identify anomalies in road traffic patterns.

## âœ¨ Features
- Motion/event-based detection
- Anomaly detection using statistical analysis
- Extendable for ML/DL integration

## í³‚ Project Structure
- `traffic_analysis.py` â†’ Python script for anomaly detection
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Dependencies
- `README.md` â†’ Documentation

## âš™ï¸ Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Road Incident Detection íº¦

The **Road Incident Detection** project is a computer vision application designed to detect unusual motion events (accidents, traffic jams, sudden stops) in road surveillance footage. It provides a baseline motion-based detector with extendable architecture for integrating advanced deep learning models later.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Real-time motion-based detection of road incidents.
- Works with videos, webcam feeds, or live streams.
- Saves annotated videos with bounding boxes.
- Configurable detection sensitivity and frame skipping.
- Lightweight, runs on CPU (no GPU required).
- Extendable for advanced ML/DL integration.
