Our work introduces a scalable, real-time pipeline for detecting road accidents and anomalies using **live traffic data feeds**.

---

## Key Features  
- ‚úÖ **Live data ingestion** from traffic APIs  
- ‚úÖ **Preprocessing pipeline** for cleaning and feature extraction  
- ‚úÖ **Anomaly detection engine** for real-time incident identification  
- ‚úÖ **Alert system** to notify with location, time, and severity  
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation framework** with accuracy, precision, recall, and latency
