Our work introduces a scalable, real-time pipeline for detecting road accidents and anomalies using **live traffic data feeds**.

---

## Key Features  
- ✅ **Live data ingestion** from traffic APIs  
- ✅ **Preprocessing pipeline** for cleaning and feature extraction  
- ✅ **Anomaly detection engine** for real-time incident identification  
- ✅ **Alert system** to notify with location, time, and severity  
- ✅ **Evaluation framework** with accuracy, precision, recall, and latency
